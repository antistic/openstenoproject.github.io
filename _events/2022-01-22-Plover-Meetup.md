This is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between the Open Steno community
and a group of professional stenographic court reporters and realtime
captioners, happening live over Zoom. The goal of this event is to raise
awareness of Open Steno initiatives among the professional stenographer
community, and create networking opportunities between them and amateur
stenographers in the Open Steno community.
